# Arduino-Brushless-motor-driver-
control QS-909 JYQD brushless motor driver with Arduino Uno board
In this project we control Brushless motor with arduino Uno using BLDC Brushless motor driver(QS-909 JYQD), I use (ZLLG80ASM250-L)Brushless electric wheel Hub Servo motor, it is 24 volt 150watt, Outer rotor type.
So easy I write simple code that can control the speed and motor rotation direction, it easy explained in code comand.
This motor can use for example in robot wheels or smart vacuum cleaner.
Schematic and code file is include here.
i hope you are find easy and helpful...
